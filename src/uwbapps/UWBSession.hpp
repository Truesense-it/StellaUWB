/**
 * @brief UWB Session wrapper class
 * A UWB (Ultra-Wideband) Session refers to a defined period during which two or
 * more UWB devices communicate for specific tasks, such as ranging (distance 
 * measurement), secure data exchange, or location tracking. A session 
 * encompasses the entire process of setting up, managing, and terminating 
 * communication between devices, all while ensuring timing, synchronization, 
 * and reliability of the data exchanged
 * 
 * Key Concepts of a UWB Session:
 * 
 *     Session Initialization:
 *         A UWB session begins with device discovery and session setup. During 
 *         this phase, UWB devices (such as a tag and an anchor) identify each 
 *         other and establish the parameters necessary for communication.
 *         This process can happen, for example, over BLE (see the Nearby demo) 
 *         or one can use hardwired values on all participants (the other demos) 
 *         Parameters include session ID (a unique identifier for the session), 
 *         channel number, preamble code, data rate, and security requirements.
 * 
 *     Session Identifier (Session ID):
 *         Each UWB session is assigned a unique Session ID that differentiates it 
 *         from other sessions. This ID ensures that devices communicate only with 
 *         the intended session participants, even in environments where multiple 
 *         UWB sessions are occurring simultaneously.
 * 
 *     Message Exchange and Timing:
 *         UWB sessions involve a series of timed message exchanges, particularly 
 *         in ranging applications. Precise timing and sequence control are vital 
 *         since UWB devices use time-of-flight measurements to calculate 
 *         distances.
 *         In a ranging session, these exchanges typically follow a defined 
 *         protocol, such as Two-Way Ranging (TWR) or Time-Difference of Arrival 
 *         (TDoA), with each message assigned a slot or time period to avoid 
 *         collisions.
 * 
 *     Session Control and Management:
 *         Session control includes mechanisms to ensure that messages follow the 
 *         correct sequence, detect any errors, and manage retries or 
 *         retransmissions as needed.
 *         Sequence control helps track the order of messages to maintain 
 *         synchronization and timing accuracy, which is essential for correct 
 *         ranging results.
 *         Additional control measures may include dynamic adjustments to session 
 *         parameters, such as adapting the data rate or power level based on 
 *         environmental conditions or the presence of other UWB devices.
 * 
 *     Security and Authentication:
 *         UWB sessions often use authentication and encryption to ensure secure 
 *         communication between devices. For example, secure key exchanges or 
 *         cryptographic techniques verify device identities and protect data from 
 *         interception or tampering.
 *         In applications such as keyless entry or secure access, this security 
 *         component is critical for preventing unauthorized access.
 * 
 *     Ranging and Data Exchange:
 *         The primary function of many UWB sessions is rangingâ€”measuring the 
 *         distance between devices. This involves a sequence of message exchanges, 
 *         where precise timestamps are captured and used to calculate the 
 *         time-of-flight, and thereby, the distance.
 *         For data exchange sessions, UWB can transmit additional data along with 
 *         timing information, supporting applications like file sharing or 
 *         device discovery in a secure and synchronized manner.
 * 
 *     Session Termination:
 *         A UWB session ends once the purpose of the session has been fulfilled, 
 *         such as when a location has been established, or data has been exchanged.
 *         Termination may involve specific messages to signal the end of the 
 *         session and ensure all resources are released, which helps reduce power 
 *         consumption and clears the channel for other devices.
 * 
 * 
 * This class implements the basic operations for a Session such as 
 * initialization, deinitialization starting and stopping.
 * 
 * Moreover it takes care of setting up the session parameters via two public 
 * members:
 *  
 * UWBRangingParams rangingParams;
 * UWBAppParamList appParams;
 * 
 * Ranging Parameters are low-level settings that directly control the technical 
 * aspects of the UWB ranging process. These parameters are essential for 
 * determining the behavior and quality of the ranging session, influencing how 
 * distance is measured, synchronized, and processed.
 *
 * Application Parameters are higher-level settings that define how the UWB 
 * session interacts with the application layer and fulfill specific application 
 * requirements. 
 * These parameters help tailor the UWB experience to the needs of the end-user 
 * application, such as security, device management, and data exchange.
